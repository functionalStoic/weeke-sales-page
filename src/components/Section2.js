            The purchase of a new reciprocating spray machine is not as
            straight-forward as it should be. Additional expenses will include
            duct work for ventilation(included), a minimum of 4 automatic
            sprayers from Kremlin, etc (included), various electrical
            necessities(480v transformer included along with breakers and
            wiring). You will need to find a source for paper rolls (we've
            included a pallet of 4)
